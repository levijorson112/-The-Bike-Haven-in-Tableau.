Dataset
You can download the .tar database file from here and the budgets.csv from here
Please restore the database provided into pgAdmin. It contains 7 tables including customer,
sales, date, product, category, subcategory, and geography. Utilize SQL to merge tables where
necessary, such as combining the product, category, and subcategory tables. You may also join
the customer and geography tables. Remove any unnecessary columns and take data as per
your needs. Once this preprocessing is complete, you may download the merged tables in CSV
format from postgres for loading into Tableau Desktop

Below are some visualizations that you have to add to the dashboard. The five visualizations
mentioned below must be present in the dashboard/ story, you may add more visualizations as
per your understanding of the case.
● Top 10 products by sales amount: This will allow you to see which products are
generating the most revenue for the company.
● Top 10 customers: This will help you identify your most valuable customers, and allow
you to focus on providing them with excellent customer service and building long-term
relationships.
● Sales figures vs. budget: You could create a chart or table that compares your actual
sales figures to your budgeted sales figures for each month. This will help you identify
any months where you're falling short of your goals, and allow you to take action to
improve performance.
● Sales figures by region/city: If you have multiple store locations, you could create a
chart or map that shows sales figures by region. This will help you identify any regional
trends or opportunities for growth.
● Product categories vs. sales amount: Creating a chart or graph that shows product
category vs. sales will give you an overview of how each product category is performing.
This can help you identify which categories are generating the most revenue for the
company and which ones need more attention.
● You can add other information to the dashboard to show your creativity, you can also
create a story instead of dashboard.
Remember to keep the dashboard user-friendly and easy to navigate, so that Chris can quickly
and easily access the information he needs.The dashboard/story should be created in A4
portrait size and should be saved in a pdf format only. Good luck with the project!
